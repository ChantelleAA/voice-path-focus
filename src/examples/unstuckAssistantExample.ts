Based on your task breakdown, I can see you're working on "Build a React App" and you've completed setting up the project structure and installing dependencies. You're currently stuck on step 3: "Create components".

Here's how to move forward:

1. **Start with a simple component**: Create a basic functional component like a Button or Card
2. **Use the project structure you set up**: Place components in a dedicated folder
3. **Follow React best practices**: Use proper naming conventions and export/import statements
4. **Test as you go**: Make sure each component renders before moving to the next

Since you've already completed the setup steps, you have a solid foundation. Focus on creating one component at a time rather than trying to build everything at once.

Would you like me to help you with the specific structure for your first component?
